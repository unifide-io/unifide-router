  <h2>About Unifide</h2>
  <div class="about-content first">
  Unifide came together as a team of thinkers, tinkerers, and misfits with a shared passion for new technologies. Our goal is to have Unifide challenge how people think to interact with each other online.
  </div>
  <div class="about-content first">
  In this day and age, keeping up with one’s projects and social life requires juggling dozens of different platforms. It’s easy to feel fatigue over managing so much information coming from different places. Things start to fall between the cracks.
  </div>
  <div class="about-content first">
  Our mission is to fix that problem. We want the start of a new project to feel effortless. We want learning a new skill to be enjoyable. We want to make accessing internet services simpler and allow doing so with others. Though our platform solely extends to social applications, we are working diligently to develop collaborative and streaming components that will make working with someone online feel a little more like you’re both in the same room
  </div>
  <div class="about-content second">
  Unifide is currently made possible by personal investment from its co-founders. We are always looking for feedback on how we’re doing and what we can improve on.
