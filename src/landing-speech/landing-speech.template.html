  <h2>Do What You Do - Better</h2>

  <div class="about-content first">
    Unifide is a collaborative web platform created by a team of thinkers, misfits, and tinkerers with a shared passion for new technologies. Our goal is to disrupt current internet communication methods and fundamentally redefine how people use web applications and services. We aim to accomplish this by making internet services simpler and more interactive. Unifide uses modular web components to create frictionless workflows and media-rich experiences online. We are dedicated to the idea of bringing people together in new ways. We believe that mutual interests are just as important as mutual friends.
  </div>

  <div class="about-content first">
    We want Unifide to be the glue that connects people, projects, and ideas together to make the world feel a little closer. We donâ€™t want you to substitute the apps and services you already use. We want to help you use them better. Unifide will allow people to interact online in ways that no single communication method can compare to. We combine video chat, messaging, and media streaming in a way that better fits your needs.
  </div>

  <div class="about-content first">
    Though our platform solely extends to social applications at this time, we have an extensive development roadmap including collaborative and streaming components, an open source toolkit for community development, and efficient low-level hardware utilization methods for web applications.
  </div>

  <div class="about-content second">
    Unifide is currently made possible by personal investment from its co-founders. We are always looking to expand our team, network, and platform. Please send all inquiries to questions@unifide.io
